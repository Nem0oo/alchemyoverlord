    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
    This web page is all about beer-related calculators and 
    my blog of beer experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
    These calculators and blog posts are graciously hosted by <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and are free of ads and trackers.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site" target="_blank">mirror</a> of the blog is available at <a href="https://alchemyoverlord.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> (with advertising that supports WordPress).
    </p>
    <p>
    The names "beering" and "alchemy overlord" are meant to be tongue-in-cheek.
    Despite the technical nature of the blog and the calculators, I don't want 
    to be overly serious about something as enjoyable as beer.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you'd like to contact me, send an e-mail to the name associated
    with this blog (no spaces) at yah&omicron;&omicron;.  
    I appreciate any comments, questions, and/or bug reports.  I try 
    to respond in a reasonable amount of time, but
    it might be up to a week if I'm really busy with my day job.
    </p>
