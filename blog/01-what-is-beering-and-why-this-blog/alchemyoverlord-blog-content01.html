What is beering? and why this blog?
</span>

<p>
This is a blog about "beering," i.e. the process of making beer, reading about beer, analyzing beer, and enjoying beer.  While beering is just a hobby for me, I know what I like, I have fun conducting experiments, and I keep good notes.

<p>
I have gleaned a lot of information from the internet and a number of truly wonderful books and papers; this blog is an attempt to give back to the beering community in a way that is not tied to any particular brewing forum.  Also, this blog is not meant to be a regularly-updated site, but a place where I can share, every so often, some of my results.  I edit old posts with new data, so that the posts on a particular topic are always up to date with the best information I have.

<p>
Over time, I've gravitated toward a "scientific publication" format for these posts, simply because I think it's effective at communicating the most information with the fewest words.  With recent posts being a bit long, I don't want to drag the reader down with any unnecessary words, which unfortunately also leaves out a bit (or all??) of the fun.  Behind all of the dull words and boring equations, I'm really interested in the high-level conclusions, and I hope you also find the overall topics interesting.  Feel free to skip over any details that don't interest you; they're there in order to provide a solid foundation for the conclusions.

<p>
Both “beering” and “alchemy overlord” are meant to be tongue-in-cheek names.  I don’t want to be overly serious about something as enjoyable as beer.
