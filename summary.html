    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    The link(s) on the left provide calculators for various beer-related
    computations.  The list includes:
    <ul>
    <li> an IBU calculator using the Tinseth formula
    <li> an IBU calculator using the Rager formula
    <li> an IBU calculator using the Garetz formula
    <li> an IBU calculator for the mIBU method described on my blog
    <li> an IBU calculator for the SMPH method described on my blog
    <li> a page for estimating the hop freshness factor (or alpha-acid
         decay over time) and hop storage index (HSI)
    <li> a calculator for the relationship between specific gravity,
         volume, and time
    <li> a calculator for correcting specific gravity, pH, and volume
         based on temperature (and a gravity &harr; &deg;Plato converter)
    <li> a tutorial on perceptual difference testing using interactive
        worksheets
    <li> a web page for searching for optimal parameter values for the
         SMPH model, and for evaluating the SMPH model on development or
         test data
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    The source code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for these calculators can
    be seen by clicking on the "source code" link above.  Of note,
    the file <code>js/trainingData.js</code> provides the specific conditions
    used in brewing the 339 beers with measured IBU values (and assumed
    conditions for four beers reported by Val Peacock in "The International
    Bitterness Unit, Its Creation, and What it Measures" in <em>Hop Flavor
    and Aroma</em>) that were used to find parameter values for the SMPH model.
    The file <code>js/developmentData.js</code> provides the specific
    conditions used in brewing the 13 beers with measured IBU values used
    as cross-validation data to develop the SMPH model.
    The file <code>js/testData.js</code> provides specifics on the 14 beers
    used in testing the IBU models.

    The "blog" link above will take you to my blog, which is all about
    experimenting with the process of making beer.
