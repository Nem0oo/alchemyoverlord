TODO:

 . IBU as a function of grain / beer color (?)

 . redo IBU as function of age, with separate IAA and nonIAA components

 . re-analyze with oAA nonzero, oBA close to zero, and vice versa, just for fun.

 . add in functionality for pellets, fix testData.js

 . add in hop variety pull-down

 . on test data, searching for beta acids doesn't help as much as expected 
   for ESB or XtraIPA.  Other cases, get good results just searching for
   alpha acids.  This suggests the model isn't quite right, but it's
   not clear what to do about it.

 . test on chrome.

 . add miscellaneous calculators
 		- evaporation rate from change in SG
		- map Plato <-> SG
		- correct SG based on temperature
		- correct pH based on temperature
		- correct volume based on temperature
		- compute yeast pitching rate
		- predict beer color from grains
		- predict HSI <-> freshness factor <-> age, temp, storage factor, variety
    - keg weight <-> volume for corny keg

 . learn how to read/write local file
 . add in ability to save state to file, read from file
 . if add hops before start of boil... how to deal with this?

 . create larger system
        - create local parameters template (volume of trub left behind, etc)
        - create local process template (output template)
        - create larger system
        - write results to file

NOTES on larger system:

grain : ** type (include extract)
        ** color
        ** %extract
        ** weight
        absorbing factor
        volume contributing factor

water : ** number of infusions
        ** amount of water
        ** pH of water
        ** other water chemistry

mash:   ** pH adjustment
        ** single temp vs step mash
                ** target time
                ** target temp
                   temp of water additions

hops:   ** additions
        absorbing factor
        volume contributing factor

boil:   volume vs. temp
        ** evaporation rate
        ** trub left
        ** cooling (natural & forced)
        ** target volume

ferment: ** yeast type, amount
        ** use secondary?  
                if so, loss
        ** temperature (max)

conditioning: ** bottle vs keg
        ** carbonation 
        ** temperature (and time)
        ** priming sugar
