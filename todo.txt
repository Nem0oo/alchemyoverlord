TODO:

 . add krausen information to development data?

 . redo IBU as function of age, with separate IAA and nonIAA components

 . add in functionality for pellets, fix testData.js

 . add in hop variety pull-down

 . test on chrome.

 . add miscellaneous calculators
 		- evaporation rate from change in SG
		- map Plato <-> SG
		- correct SG based on temperature
		- correct pH based on temperature
		- correct volume based on temperature
		- compute yeast pitching rate
		- predict beer color from grains
		- predict HSI <-> freshness factor <-> age, temp, storage factor, variety
    - keg weight <-> volume for corny keg

 . learn how to read/write local file
 . add in ability to save state to file, read from file
 . if add hops before start of boil... how to deal with this?

 . create larger system
        - create local parameters template (volume of trub left behind, etc)
        - create local process template (output template)
        - create larger system
        - write results to file

NOTES on larger system:

grain : ** type (include extract)
        ** color
        ** %extract
        ** weight
        absorbing factor
        volume contributing factor

water : ** number of infusions
        ** amount of water
        ** pH of water
        ** other water chemistry

mash:   ** pH adjustment
        ** single temp vs step mash
                ** target time
                ** target temp
                   temp of water additions

hops:   ** additions
        absorbing factor
        volume contributing factor

boil:   volume vs. temp
        ** evaporation rate
        ** trub left
        ** cooling (natural & forced)
        ** target volume

ferment: ** yeast type, amount
        ** use secondary?  
                if so, loss
        ** temperature (max)

conditioning: ** bottle vs keg
        ** carbonation 
        ** temperature (and time)
        ** priming sugar
