TODO:

 . check up on Firefox beta issue if load index.html, not getting
   any saved values; error in script.  works on older version of
   Firefox and on Chrome.

 . add in hop variety pull-down

 . add krausen information to SMPH development and test data?

 . redo IBU as function of age, with separate IAA and nonIAA components

 . redo analysis with results from teamaker hops

 . add in functionality for pellets, fix testData.js

 . test on chrome.

 . add miscellaneous calculators
    - evaporation rate from change in SG
    - map Plato <-> SG
    - correct SG based on temperature
    - correct pH based on temperature
    - correct volume based on temperature
    - compute yeast pitching rate
    - predict beer color from grains
    - predict HSI <-> freshness factor <-> age, temp, storage factor, variety
    - keg weight <-> volume for corny keg

 . learn how to read/write local file
 . add in ability to save state to file, read from file
 . if add hops before start of boil... how to deal with this?

 . create larger system
        - create local parameters template (volume of trub left behind, etc)
        - create local process template (output template)
        - create larger system
        - write results to file

NOTES on larger system:

grain : ** type (include extract)
        ** color
        ** %extract or PPG
        ** weight
        absorbing factor
        volume contributing factor

water : ** number of infusions
        ** amount of water
        ** pH of water
        ** other water chemistry

mash:   ** pH adjustment
        ** water to grist ratio, target SG
        ** single temp vs step mash
                ** target time
                ** target temp
                   temp of water additions
        ** single infusion, multiple infusions
        ** single sparge, batch sparge, xx sparge

hops:   ** additions
        absorbing factor
        volume contributing factor

boil:   volume vs. temp
        ** evaporation rate
        ** trub left
        ** cooling (natural & forced)
        ** target volume

ferment: ** yeast type, amount
        ** use secondary?
                if so, loss
        ** secondary fermentation temperature (max)

conditioning: ** bottle vs keg
        ** carbonation
        ** temperature (and time)
        ** priming sugar
