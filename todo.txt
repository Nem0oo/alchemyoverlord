    (code: modelPP.tcl, modelIBUs.tcl = hypothetical models)
    (code: estimateIBUs.tcl estimatePP.tcl = analyze data)

+2. update Teamaker blog post on oBA with new numbers and examples
    (code: modelPP.tcl and modelIBUs.tcl = hypothetical models)
    (code: ibu.tcl = analysis of data)

    Note PP levels increase during the boil, as expected? (see notes below)

+10. re-analyze first CvP experiments using oAA not just nonIAA.

+11. blog post on CvP with solubility limits, note PP levels don't
    explain increase in IBUs.
    (code: ibu.tcl = analyze IBU data)
    (code: PP.tcl = analyze PP data)
    OR: don't make this a separate blog post, since it simply
    conforms with the existing solubility model.  Just include
    the PP results in the "why do pellets have higher IBUs" blog post.

+12. FV experiment #1 : analyze
+13. FV experiment #1 : blog post -> don't bother

     update Techniques for Maximizing:
       + order in terms of amount of hops, then freshness, etc.

 38. blog posts:
     - Three Misconceptions About the IBU
         - "IBUs are meaningless"
             - talking about measured IBUs, not formulas
             - correlated with perceived bitterness
             - reproducible, not random, low variance in controlled conditions
         - "IBU = IAA"
             - confusion based on history
             - shellhammer contribution of oAA
             - my contribution of oAA
             - other ABCs
             - utilization curve back to time 0
         - An IBU calculator will give you a good estimate of real IBUs
           (best approximation by very detailed analysis of
            volumes at multiple points in the process, hop storage
            index, AA analysis, specification of all factors; even
            with that, lots of unknowns and variability)
            If can get IBU analyzed, that is best.  If can't,
            then understand that calculator result is only approximation
            and accuracy depends on model assumptions and input measurements
          - Example: Alice and Bob brew two batches following the same
            recipe.  But due to different techniques, the arrive at
            very different IBUs.  So it's not just a question of choosing
            the right model, but of accounting for all of the factors
            that affect IBUs
     - SMPH model

 39. review all blog posts, make copies of all blog posts,
     get copied HTML to display correctly

 40. put blog posts on github.
