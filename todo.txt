TODO:

 . analyze protein experiment, fit data to formula, figure out how
   much impact on IAA and nonIAA.

 . next beer: take 1 sample immediately after cooling, 1 after resting,
   and compare both with "standard" IBU value to look at impact of break.
   also get two more data points for impact of size of FV.

 . blog post: how the concentration of hot and cold break during fermentation affects IBUs
 . blog post: impact of fermentation vessel and volume on IBUs



 . analyze sampling-experiment data to figure out oAA Exp #1 *-POST results.
   > mixing in break has negative impact on IBUs
   > fermentation surface area has positive impact on IBUs

 . malt PP beer #72:
      ANALYZE : OG 1.030 1.050 1.070 x 2 = 6 samples
                OG 1.030@low pH, 1.050 before and after ferment, 1.070@10,60min
      6 samples for PP and IBU analysis

 . analyze oAA Exp #1 PP at 10 and 40: does PP level change during boil?
   YES.  91 mg/L at 10 min -> 107 mg/L at 40 min
   Is this all hops PP, or does malt PP increase?  (see malt PP analysis)

 . analyze CVP #6 PP levels as function of hop concentration: 
    . linear? : if maltPP = 100
                measured (112-100)/150.0 = 0.08
                         (130-100)/400.0 = 0.075
                         (141-100)/600.0 = 0.068
                if maltPP = 100, then not quite linear : ratio = -0.00002639*[]+0.08445
                but pretty close to linear; not obvious nonlinearity
    . use these points to estimate malt PP before adding hops. : 100 mg/L
    . are the values for malt and hops PP in line with expectations? No: malt is 2x pred.
      either formula is off, fermentation has an effect, or scale_PPmalt != scale_PPhops
    . update "Four Experiemnts" and model of IBUs from malt. : do experiment above

 . analyze oAA Exp #1 : rate of oAA production during boil as fn of temp?
   (want better malt PP model before doing this analysis.)


 . AA model: re-analyze AA solubility limit data with new info about oAA

 . redo IBU as function of age, with separate IAA and nonIAA components
   (see CVP experiment looking at how levels change with age... IAA and
    nonIAA change differently)


 . change SMPH model to reflect new AA solubility limit model, oAA production
   as function of temp, PP levels constant(?) over time, malt PP model

 . add in functionality for pellets (fix testData.js??)

 . extract parameters from SMPH model, evaluate on dev and test data

 . if results on dev and test are consistently high/low, include dev and/or
   test in training data and remove them from dev/test set.


 . taste experiment: either use expected technique after fix, or get IAA
   and add to finished beer. (see HopTech web page)
   98 drops / tsp, 1/8 tsp = 12.25 drops in 5 gallons -> 1 IBU
   if brew 0.75 gallons, then 1 IBU = 12.25 * 0.75 / 5 = 1.8375 drops

 . new experiment: impact of gelatin fining on IBUs
 . new experiment: impact of dry hopping on IBUs (?)


 . blog: oAA production (?)
 . blog: estimating AA solubility limit: re-do completely
 . blog: source of increased IBUs in pellets, re-do
 . blog: a summary of factors: add PP data, pellet data
 . blog: taste experiment



 . test all calculators on chrome.

 . add miscellaneous calculators
    - evaporation rate from change in SG
    - map Plato <-> SG
    - correct SG based on temperature
    - correct pH based on temperature
    - correct volume based on temperature
    - compute yeast pitching rate
    - predict beer color from grains
    - predict HSI <-> freshness factor <-> age, temp, storage factor, variety
    - keg weight <-> volume for corny keg

 . add save/load functionality to mIBU HTML

 . create larger system
        - create local parameters template (volume of trub left behind, etc)
        - create local process template (output template)
        - create larger system
        - write results to file
